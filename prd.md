- **Created**: July 9, 2025
- **Document Type**: Product Requirements Document
- **Complexity Level**: Medium

## Executive Summary
### Product Vision
DriveReady empowers learner drivers in the UK to quickly secure driving test appointments by providing real-time alerts for cancellations and intelligently matching instructor availability, ultimately reducing wait times and simplifying the learning journey.

### Success Definition
Achieve 50,000 downloads in Year 1 with a 20% conversion rate to the paid tier (£4.99/month), generating £600,000 in revenue.  Maintain an 80%+ alert delivery rate within 30 seconds of slot availability and a 25% booking conversion rate (from alert to successful booking).

### Primary User Journey
A learner driver downloads DriveReady, creates an account, links their driving instructor's profile, sets their preferred test centers and maximum travel radius, and activates real-time alerts.  They receive a push notification when a matching cancellation becomes available, are directed to the booking platform, and successfully secure their desired test date.

## User Context
### Target Users
- **Primary User**: Learner drivers in the UK aged 17-45, tech-savvy, using smartphones (70% iOS, 30% Android).  They are frustrated with long wait times for driving tests and struggle to find cancellations. They value speed and convenience and are willing to pay for a solution that helps them book a test faster.
- **Secondary Users**: Driving instructors in the UK who want to streamline the booking process for their students and manage their availability effectively.

### User Problems Solved
| Problem | Current Solution | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Long wait times for driving tests (3-6 months) | Manually checking the DVSA website multiple times a day, relying on word-of-mouth, or using less reliable third-party alert services. | Real-time alerts for cancellations, prioritized by user preferences and instructor availability. |
| Difficulty finding cancellations |  Refreshing the DVSA website constantly, often missing short-lived availability windows. | Instant push notifications as soon as a slot opens up, maximizing the chances of securing a booking. |
| Coordinating schedules with driving instructors |  Back-and-forth communication to find mutually available times, adding complexity to the booking process. | Integrated instructor availability syncing, ensuring alerts are only sent for slots that work for both the student and instructor. |
