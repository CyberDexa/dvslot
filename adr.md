# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Technology Stack Selection for Appointment Availability Alert App

## Status
Proposed

## Context

**Problem Statement and Business Context:**  The app aims to provide real-time alerts for appointment availability across various platforms, initially focusing on DVSA driving tests in the UK.  The core challenge is efficiently monitoring numerous websites, detecting changes in availability, and delivering timely notifications to a potentially large user base.  Scalability, reliability, and anti-bot measures are critical.

**Key Requirements from the PRD:**

* **Real-time monitoring:**  Scrape/API integration with ~380 DVSA test centers.
* **Push notifications:**  Instant alerts to users when slots open.
* **Scalability:** Handle a large number of users and frequent data updates.
* **Location-based filtering:** Users specify search radius.
* **Anti-bot measures:** Prevent abuse and ensure fair access.
* **Multi-platform support:**  iOS, Android, and potentially web.
* **Phased rollout:** Start with DVSA practical tests, then expand.

**Technical Constraints and Considerations:**

* Website structures and APIs of target platforms may change frequently.
* Robust error handling and retry mechanisms are needed for web scraping.
* The need for sophisticated anti-bot measures adds complexity.
* Server costs for continuous monitoring need to be optimized.

**Scale and Performance Expectations:**

* Initially, focus on UK-wide coverage for DVSA tests.
* Expect high traffic spikes during peak availability periods.
* Low latency for push notifications is crucial.


## Decision

**Technology Stack Selection with Justification:**

* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.  Node.js offers excellent performance and scalability for real-time applications, and its large ecosystem provides readily available libraries for web scraping, task scheduling, and push notifications.  Express.js simplifies API development.
* **Database:**  PostgreSQL.  A robust, relational database suitable for handling structured data like user profiles, preferences, and appointment details.  Its scalability and ACID properties ensure data integrity.
* **Caching:** Redis.  In-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., appointment availability) to reduce database load and improve response times.
* **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ.  Handles asynchronous tasks like web scraping and push notification delivery, improving responsiveness and decoupling components.
* **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).  Cross-platform solution for sending push notifications to iOS and Android devices efficiently.
* **Web Scraping Library:** Puppeteer (Node.js).  Powerful library for headless browser automation, enabling robust web scraping even with dynamic websites.
* **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native.  Allows for cross-platform development (iOS and Android) with a single codebase, reducing development time and cost.
* **Frontend (Web - optional future phase):** React.js.  Consistent with the mobile frontend technology, leveraging the React ecosystem.
* **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  Provides scalable infrastructure, managed services (databases, message queues), and cost-effective solutions.


**Architecture Patterns and Design Decisions:**

* **Microservices Architecture:**  Separate services for user management, appointment monitoring, notification delivery, and data processing.  This improves scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.
* **Event-driven Architecture:**  Leverage RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous events, ensuring loose coupling between services.
* **API-first approach:**  Well-defined APIs for communication between services and clients.


**Database and Storage Solutions:**

* PostgreSQL for structured data.
* Redis for caching.
* Cloud storage (AWS S3 or GCP Cloud Storage) for storing large files (if needed).


**API Design and Integration Approach:**

* RESTful APIs for communication between services and clients.
* Well-defined data models and schemas.
* Versioning of APIs to handle future changes.


**Security and Authentication Strategy:**

* OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and authorization.
* Secure storage of sensitive data (encryption at rest and in transit).
* Regular security audits and penetration testing.
* Rate limiting and CAPTCHA to mitigate bot attacks.


## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes and Benefits:**

* Scalable and robust architecture capable of handling a large user base.
* Efficient real-time monitoring and notification delivery.
* Reduced development time and cost through cross-platform development.
* Improved maintainability and flexibility through microservices architecture.

**Negative Consequences and Trade-offs:**

* Increased complexity compared to a monolithic architecture.
* Higher initial setup and infrastructure costs.
* Requires expertise in multiple technologies.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

* Thorough testing and quality assurance.
* Continuous monitoring and logging.
* Gradual rollout and phased feature releases.
* Robust error handling and retry mechanisms.


**Future Implications:**

* Easy expansion to support other appointment platforms (NHS, embassies).
* Potential for monetization through premium features or subscriptions.


## Implementation Notes

**Development Setup and Tooling:**

* Git for version control.
* Docker for containerization.
* Kubernetes for orchestration (potentially).
* CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

**Key Dependencies and Libraries:**

* Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Puppeteer, React Native, Firebase Cloud Messaging.

**Deployment and Infrastructure Considerations:**

* Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS or GCP).
* Automated deployment using CI/CD.
* Monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

**Monitoring and Observability:**

* Comprehensive logging and monitoring of all services.
* Real-time dashboards for tracking key metrics (e.g., request latency, error rates, queue lengths).
* Alerting system for critical issues.
