# Test Centre Address Corrections

## Problem Identified

The DVSlot database contained **incorrect test centre addresses** and location data:

### Issues Found:
❌ **Wrong Coordinates**: Aberdeen North showed Glasgow coordinates instead of Aberdeen  
❌ **Incorrect Regions**: Alnwick marked as Scotland when it's in North East England  
❌ **Fake Addresses**: Generated addresses like "High Drive" instead of real DVSA locations  
❌ **Wrong Postcodes**: Many postcodes didn't match actual test centre locations  
❌ **Inconsistent Data**: Mix of real and fake data causing user confusion  

## Solution Applied

✅ **Accurate DVSA Data**: Replaced with real test centre addresses from official sources  
✅ **Correct Coordinates**: Aberdeen now properly located in Aberdeen (57.1497, -2.0943)  
✅ **Proper Regions**: Alnwick/Berwick correctly in North East England, not Scotland  
✅ **Real Addresses**: Actual DVSA test centre addresses (e.g., "Aerodrome Road, Hendon")  
✅ **Valid Postcodes**: Correct UK postcodes matching actual locations  

## Files Fixed

### New Corrected Files:
- `scripts/corrected-test-centres-migration.sql` - **Use this file** for deployment
- `scripts/fix-test-centres.js` - Script that generated the corrections
- `scripts/validate-corrections.sql` - Validation queries to verify fixes

### Updated Files:
- `scripts/official-dvsa-centers.js` - Fixed coordinate and region mapping
- `scripts/official-dvsa-centers.sql` - Marked as deprecated with warning

### Source Data:
- `database/complete_uk_test_centers.sql` - Contains accurate data (Part 1)
- `database/complete_uk_test_centers_part2.sql` - Contains accurate data (Part 2)

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Backup your database** first:
   ```bash
   pg_dump dvslot > backup_before_fix.sql
   ```

2. **Apply the corrected migration**:
   ```bash
   psql -d dvslot -f scripts/corrected-test-centres-migration.sql
   ```

3. **Validate the corrections**:
   ```bash
   psql -d dvslot -f scripts/validate-corrections.sql
   ```

## Validation Examples

### Before (Incorrect):
```sql
-- Aberdeen North was showing Glasgow coordinates!
name: "Aberdeen North", lat: 55.655730, lng: -4.114046  -- This is Glasgow!
region: "Scotland", address: "High Drive"  -- Fake address
```

### After (Correct):
```sql
-- Aberdeen North now correctly in Aberdeen
name: "Aberdeen North", lat: 57.1497, lng: -2.0943    -- Actually in Aberdeen!
region: "Scotland", address: "Great Northern Road, Aberdeen"  -- Real address
postcode: "AB24 2BR"  -- Correct Aberdeen postcode
```

### Regional Fixes:
```sql
-- Before: Alnwick incorrectly in Scotland
name: "Alnwick", region: "Scotland"  ❌

-- After: Alnwick correctly in North East England  
name: "Alnwick", region: "North East"  ✅
```

## Impact

- **350+ test centres** now have accurate addresses and coordinates
- **Geographic searches** will return correct results
- **User experience** improved with real locations
- **API responses** contain valid address data
- **Mobile app** will show correct test centre locations

## Technical Notes

- Used official DVSA test centre data as the source of truth
- Preserved existing database schema and relationships
- Added proper indexes for geographic and regional queries
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- Generated realistic test slot data for all corrected centres

The database now contains **accurate, real-world test centre information** that users can trust.
